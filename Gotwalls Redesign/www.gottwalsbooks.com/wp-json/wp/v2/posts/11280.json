Since then, we have grown to 4 stores in Middle Georgia, and we now have locations nationwide under the Walls of Books franchise.<br \/>\nOur current headquarters is a beautiful 8,100 square foot office\/warehouse building in Byron. But, we&#8217;ve needed more room! We recently announced on Facebook that we purchased a 44,000 square foot warehouse in efforts to process even more books, therefore serving more customers all over the USA.<br \/>\nWe will post updates during renovations so you can see this property transform into the new Gottwals Books headquarters.<br \/>\nOur goal is to have a combined Grand Opening and 10-Year Anniversary celebration in the Spring of 2017. The building can be seen from I-75 between Byron and Warner Robins. It was once an auto auction facility.<br \/>\nThank you, everyone, for supporting us. As we just considered the gift of Christ this season, we see this property as a reflection of God&#8217;s goodness here at Gottwals Books.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-11282\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gottwalsbooks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/GBWarehouse-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.gottwalsbooks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/GBWarehouse-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.gottwalsbooks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/GBWarehouse-208x156.jpg 208w, https:\/\/www.gottwalsbooks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/GBWarehouse-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.gottwalsbooks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/GBWarehouse.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Thinking Putty!<\/h2>\n<p>Crazy Aaron&#8217;s Thinking Putty is a silicone-based putty that is nontoxic and will never dry out.
