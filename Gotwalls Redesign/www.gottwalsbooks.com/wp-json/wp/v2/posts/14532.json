They were standing within a few feet of where the bullet came in. We praise God that they are both safe and well (and they more than deserved the paid day off we gave them!).<\/p>\n<p>WRPD has been incredible, wrapping up their full investigation (including dusting for fingerprints, reviewing surveillance footage, and creating a 3-D scan of the store) around 2:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning (they even texted me when they were done).<\/p>\n<p>We are open for business as if everything is normal&#8230; because it is. We will only allow this thug (or thugs) to take a pane of glass from us. They aren\u2019t getting anything else.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to post these photos for our customers who care so much about Gottwals Books. You deserve to be aware of what happened.<\/p>\n<p>WRPD is still investigating to determine who did this.<\/p>\n<p>We blame no one except the perpetrator(s). We are positioned between law enforcement offices (on Carl Vinson) and a gun shop 4 spaces down. This is, and has always been, a safe shopping center.<\/p>\n<p>13WMAZ and other media are covering this story, and more information will be forthcoming.<\/p>\n<p>Goes to show&#8230; these guys would profit much more by pulling out a book instead of pulling out a pistol.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.
