We motivated each other! We shared ideas, current projects, and upcoming initiatives. It was the first time all of our franchisees were together, and everyone went back home with new insights. These meetings allow us to become better people and better booksellers. We saw images and gave accounts of local events and projects each store is involved in. Walls of Books has a huge influence in cities nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what Shane Gottwals had to say: &#8220;I was taken aback&#8230; our franchise meeting helped me realize how much of an impact Walls of Books has. Our store owners provide an incredible value to each community. I love what we do, and they do too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8742\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gottwalsbooks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Meeting-1.gif\" alt=\"Meeting 1\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join us in Macon and Warner Robins on Saturday, March 26 for an Easter egg hunt!
